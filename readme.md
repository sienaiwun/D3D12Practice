# D3D12 practice
This project is based on Microsfts&copy; [MiniEngine](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/MiniEngine). Besides that I add some toy demos
## Entry
* Open ModelViewer/ModelViewer_VS15.sln
## Computer shader:
* A simple Computer shader example inspaird by [Plantary Gear](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsGczV)

## Gpu Tiles Culling:
* Accelerate draw-calls submitions using indirect draw calls generated from GPU-based tiles culling. 
In the following image, each color block is a quad draw-call. The shape is inspaird by [Heart - 2D](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsfGRn)
